## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't know how to do the Active States just by using CSS, I was trying to find a solution for that quite some time, but then I decided to try this step by using JS and I'm really happy how it turned out at the end. Apart from that, I will stick to uploading SVG in img tag with next project.
